<p>This is the first project I decided to undertake after completing the B.S. in Cloud Computing at WGU. I wanted more familiarity and experience with AWS's services, and this proved to be an insightful and interactive way of doing so. This challenge definitely provided a much stronger foundation of key AWS services. Being able to conceptualize the concepts beyond studying for various AWS certifications was interesting, and helped reinforce a lot of previous learning. This should serve as a great jumping off point into more challenging and unique projects.</p>
